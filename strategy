GitLab Story: AKS-Specific Alloy Agent Deployment Implementation
Story Details
Epic: LGTM Stack Implementation
Story Type: Feature
Story Points: 21
Priority: High
Assignee: DevOps Engineering Team
User Story
As a DevOps Engineer managing Kubernetes workloads
I want specialized Alloy agent deployment patterns optimized for Azure Kubernetes Service
So that I can efficiently collect observability data from containerized applications with native AKS integrations
Acceptance Criteria
Must Have

 AKS-optimized Helm charts with Azure-specific configurations
 Integration with Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics (optional path)
 AKS-native service discovery and auto-configuration
 Azure Active Directory integration for authentication
 Network policy templates for AKS networking
 Azure Key Vault integration for secrets management
 Horizontal Pod Autoscaler configuration for agent scaling
 AKS cluster upgrade compatibility testing
 Integration with Azure Container Insights (migration path)

Should Have

 Azure Policy integration for governance and compliance
 Cost optimization with Azure Spot node pools
 Integration with Azure Arc for hybrid scenarios
 AKS diagnostic settings integration
 Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template for infrastructure
 Terraform modules for infrastructure as code

Could Have

 Integration with Azure DevOps pipelines
 Azure Cost Management integration for observability cost tracking
 Azure Security Center integration for vulnerability scanning
 Azure Advisor integration for optimization recommendations

Story 2: Azure VM Alloy Agent Deployment Strategy
Epic: LGTM Stack Implementation
Story: Implement Azure VM Alloy Agent Deployment
Priority: High
Story Points: 13
As an application team running services on Azure VMs
I want a standardized way to deploy and configure Alloy agents
So that I can easily send telemetry data to the centralized LGTM stack
Acceptance Criteria:

 Create Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates for agent deployment
 Develop PowerShell/Bash scripts for automated installation
 Implement configuration management using Azure App Configuration or Key Vault
 Create service definition for Windows Service/systemd daemon
 Establish log rotation and agent self-monitoring
 Document firewall and network security requirements

Technical Deliverables:

ARM template for VM agent deployment
Installation scripts (Windows PowerShell + Linux Bash)
Systemd service file and Windows service wrapper
Configuration management integration
Health check endpoints and monitoring configuration

Definition of Done:

 Templates tested on Windows and Linux VMs
 Agent successfully sends data to development LGTM stack
 Configuration updates work without agent restart
 Documentation completed with troubleshooting guide
