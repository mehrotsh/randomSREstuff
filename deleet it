**Subject:** Q4 Achievements in SRE & Observability  


I am pleased to present a summary of our team's achievements in Q4, which primarily focused on stabilizing and enhancing our Kubernetes monitoring stack (Prometheus, Cortex, and Grafana). Our efforts have been validated by Syed from the TOC, who affirmed the positive outcomes during our platform improvement sync-ups.  

### **Q4 Achievements**  

1. **Stabilization of Kubernetes Monitoring Stack**  
   As part of three production releases, we accomplished the following:  
   - **Cortex Scheduler Cronjob**: Introduced a cronjob pod to restart Cortex-scheduler pods hourly. This resolved the long-standing Grafana dashboard loading issue.  
   - **Cross-Environment Query Fix**: Addressed the issue causing dashboards to incorrectly display HA environment data.  
   - **Prometheus as a StatefulSet**: Transitioned Prometheus from Deployment to StatefulSet, ensuring that data persists when pods are moved or restarted.  
   - **Alert Refinement**: Streamlined Prometheus alerts to reduce noise and standardized labels for better actionability.  

2. **Pod CPU/Memory Right-Sizing Dashboard**  
   We rolled out a Grafana dashboard that provides recommendations for optimal CPU and memory requests for pods. This tool allows us to identify resource utilization per namespace and make precise resource adjustments.  
   *(Attached: Screenshot showcasing the savings advice provided by the dashboard.)*  

3. **BigPanda Integration in Non-Prod**  
   Successfully integrated BigPanda in our non-production environments, paving the way for enhanced incident management.  

4. **Documentation**  
   Compiled a comprehensive Confluence document listing all production alerts and Grafana dashboards. Each entry includes a brief description of its purpose and use. *(Link to Confluence provided.)*

### **Proposed Next Steps**  

To further enhance our observability and platform capabilities, we aim to:  

1. **Increase Platform Adoption**  
   - Schedule regular sync-ups with development pods and support teams to promote the use of Prometheus/Grafana dashboards and alerts.  

2. **Develop New Dashboards**  
   - Introduce dashboards to monitor:  
     - **Out-of-Memory (OOM) Errors**  
     - **CPU Throttling**  
     - **Pod Restarts**  

3. **BigPanda Production Integration**  
   - Extend the BigPanda integration to production environments.  

4. **Evaluate Azure Managed Prometheus and Grafana**  
   - Explore the cost and operational benefits of transitioning from the current setup (Prometheus, Grafana, and Cortex per environment) to Azure-managed services.  

5. **Refine Dashboard Queries**  
   - Optimize queries in existing dashboards to improve performance over long date ranges and reduce resource consumption.  

6. **Implement Synthetic Monitoring**  
   - Deploy synthetic monitoring for critical endpoints to preemptively identify and address issues.

These achievements and initiatives underscore our commitment to enhancing the platform's reliability and efficiency. I look forward to discussing these accomplishments and next steps in more detail.  

Best regards,
