Alright, let's delve into the maturity levels for each of the pillars of observability:

### 1. Logging:
#### Reactive Monitoring:
- Logs are generated but are scattered, unstructured, and hard to read.
- Manual effort is required to access and interpret logs.

#### Basic Observability:
- Centralized logging systems are adopted.
- Basic search and filter functionalities are available.

#### Advanced Observability:
- Structured logging is practiced, with standardized formats across applications.
- Integration of logs with other observability tools, allowing correlation.

#### Proactive Analysis & Prediction:
- Automated anomaly detection in logs.
- Logs provide predictive insights based on patterns.

#### Full Observability Culture:
- Logs are always associated with business and system contexts.
- Developers and operators use logs proactively during the software development life cycle.

### 2. Metrics:
#### Reactive Monitoring:
- Basic system metrics (like CPU, memory usage) are monitored using threshold-based alerts.

#### Basic Observability:
- Application-specific metrics are collected and visualized.
- Initial dashboards represent key system and application performance indicators.

#### Advanced Observability:
- Integration of metrics with other data sources, enabling richer insights.
- More granular and business-relevant metrics are collected.

#### Proactive Analysis & Prediction:
- Use of advanced analytics to derive insights from metrics.
- Predictive alerting based on trends.

#### Full Observability Culture:
- Every new feature or service has associated metrics that are monitored from day one.

### 3. Tracing:
#### Reactive Monitoring:
- Traces are collected but are hard to interpret and aren't consistently available.

#### Basic Observability:
- Basic end-to-end tracing of requests through systems.
- Ability to visualize traces and pinpoint failures.

#### Advanced Observability:
- Distributed tracing across microservices is available.
- Integration of tracing data with logs and metrics.

#### Proactive Analysis & Prediction:
- Performance bottlenecks are proactively identified using trace data.
- Predictive insights on system behavior based on trace patterns.

#### Full Observability Culture:
- Tracing is an integral part of system design.
- Every architectural decision considers its impact on traceability and performance.

Understanding the maturity levels for each pillar is crucial. It not only helps organizations identify where they currently stand but also provides a clear roadmap for advancing their observability practices. Integrating and advancing in each of these pillars in tandem ensures a holistic approach to achieving full observability.
