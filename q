How will we measure the success of our observability strategy across the organization? Are there specific business KPIs or operational metrics that should guide our observability investments and priorities?

What's the organization's long-term investment strategy for observability? Should divisions plan their observability budgets around centralized capabilities, or are we expected to maintain separate investments for specialized or domain-specific needs?

How do you envision the relationship between the central observability team and division-level teams like ours? Are we positioned as consumers of a service, contributors to a shared platform, or strategic partners in building enterprise observability capabilities?I don't see explicit mention of Real User Monitoring, synthetic monitoring, or load testing capabilities. Are these planned for future MVPs, or should divisions continue developing these capabilities independently?"


What's the intended division of responsibilities between the central team and product divisions for areas like agent configuration, data quality management, and telemetry enrichment—especially in cases where generic configurations don't meet specific workload requirements?


Our team has developed significant domain expertise in areas like OpenTelemetry instrumentation and user experience monitoring. How can this knowledge best serve the organization

When our division has specific business initiatives that require observability capabilities not yet available centrally, how should we approach this—build solutions ourselves, influence central team priorities, or adjust our business timelines?
