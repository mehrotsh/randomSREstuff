This playbook you created looks good, but I need clarification on next steps.

I want you to:
1. Use this playbook (or the one I originally provided) as your INSTRUCTIONS for how to approach the work
2. Now actually EXECUTE the planning work following those instructions
3. Generate the ACTUAL project plan deliverable with:
   - Specific tasks and subtasks for our SonarQube/Nexus observability implementation
   - Timeline estimates with dependencies
   - Architecture diagrams or detailed technical designs
   - Configuration files, Kubernetes manifests, or Helm values we'll need
   - SLI/SLO definitions with specific thresholds for our services
   - Implementation phases with acceptance criteria

Please proceed with creating the actual project plan now, using the playbook as your guide.
